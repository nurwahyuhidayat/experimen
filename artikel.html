	<p>In the early 9th century, there was an outstanding Persian mathematician called Muhammad Al-Khwarizmi known as The Father of Algebra. Al-Khwarizmi is one of the first Directors of the House of Wisdom in Bagdad. He was born in a small town called Khwarezm which is currently known as Khiva, Uzbekistan in 780 AD. However, Western and European scientists are more familiar with Al-Khwarizmi by the name Algoritm, Algorismus, or Algorithm.</p>
 

	<p>Al-khwarizmi oversaw the translation of the major Greek and Indian mathematical and astronomy works (including those of Brahmagupta) into Arabic, and produced original work which had a lasting influence on the advance of Muslim and (after his works spread to Europe through Latin translations in the 12th Century) later European mathematics.</p>

	<p>The word <b>algorithm</b> is derived from the Latinization of his name, and the word <b>algebra</b> is derived from the Latinization of <b>al-jabr</b>, part of the title of his most famous book, in which he introduced the fundamental algebraic methods and techniques for solving equations.</p>


	<p>Perhaps his most important contribution to mathematics was his strong advocacy of the Hindu numerical system, which Al-Khwarizmi recognized as having the power and efficiency needed to revolutionize Islamic and Western mathematics. The Hindu numerals 1-9 and 0, which have since become known as Hindu-Arabic numerals-were soon adopted by the entire Islamic world. Later, with translations of <b>Al-Khwarizmi's</b> work into Latin by Adelard of Bath and others in the 12th Century, and with the influence of <b>Fibonacci's Liber Abaci</b> they would be adopted throughout Europe as well.</p>


	<p>Four Latin texts providing adaptions of Al-Khwarizmi's methods have survived, even though none of them is believed to be a literal translation:<p>

<ul>

	<li><i>Dixit Algorizmi (published in 1857 under the title Algoritmi de Numero Indorum)</i></li>

	 <li><i>Liber Alchoarismi de Practica Arismetice</i></li>

	  <li><i>Liber Ysagogarum Alchorismi</i></li>
          	   <li><i>Liber Pulveris</i></li>
        
</ul>
